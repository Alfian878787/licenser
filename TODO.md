# To-Do List

* Add more licesnes: GNU, Apache, Mozilla, etc.
    * These licesnes recommend that each file in the project have a header.
    * Implementing these will also mean implementing:
        * Walking the directory and prepending the header
        * Letting the user pass in files or folders to ignore (so we don't write to binaries, etc)
* Add in the ability to create a ".licenserc" file or something so no flags or arguments are needed
